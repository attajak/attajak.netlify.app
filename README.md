[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e7bbc17c-a776-4e2e-abf7-1f36f2bdd9a8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/attajak/deploys)

## Netlify Configuration

In order to build this site with Netlify, simply log in or register at 
https://app.netlify.com/, then select "New site from Git" from the top
right. Select GitLab, authenticate if needed, and then select this
project from the list. Netlify will handle the rest.

In the meantime, you can take advantage of all the great GitLab features
like merge requests, issue tracking, epics, and everything else GitLab has
to offer.

## Troubleshooting

1. CSS is missing! That means two things:

    Either that you have wrongly set up the CSS URL in your templates, or
    your static generator has a configuration option that needs to be explicitly
    set in order to serve static assets under a relative URL.
